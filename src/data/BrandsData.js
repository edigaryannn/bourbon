            'desc1': "The Hennessy cognac distillery was founded by Irish Jacobite military officer Richard Hennessy in 1765, who had served in the army of Louis XV. He retired to the Cognac region, and began distilling and exporting brandies, first to Britain and his native Ireland, closely followed by the United States. In 1813 Richard Hennessy's son James Hennessy gave the company its trading name, Jas Hennessy & Co. He was also responsible for choosing Jean Fillioux as the house's Master Blender. A member of the Fillioux family has occupied the role ever since, a business relationship that has lasted eight generations and more than 250 years.",

            'desc2': "Could Richard Hennessy and his eldest son James possibly have imagined at the end of the eighteenth century that, one day, their cognac would have travelled the world over, ignoring borders and challenging traditions? ",
            'title3': "OUR CRAFTSMEN",
            'desc3': "Hennessy is a story of artisans. From the vineyards to the bottle finishes, all the craftsmen cultivate a deep sense of pride in what they do. Their passion is humbling. And their mastery of their craft is absolute, for each and every one. We strive to preserve these savoir-faire within the Maison and encourage transmission.",
