            'desc1': "The Hennessy cognac distillery was founded by Irish Jacobite military officer Richard Hennessy in 1765, who had served in the army of Louis XV. He retired to the Cognac region, and began distilling and exporting brandies, first to Britain and his native Ireland, closely followed by the United States. In 1813 Richard Hennessy's son James Hennessy gave the company its trading name, Jas Hennessy & Co. He was also responsible for choosing Jean Fillioux as the house's Master Blender. A member of the Fillioux family has occupied the role ever since, a business relationship that has lasted eight generations and more than 250 years.",

            'desc2': "Could Richard Hennessy and his eldest son James possibly have imagined at the end of the eighteenth century that, one day, their cognac would have travelled the world over, ignoring borders and challenging traditions? ",

            'desc3': "Hennessy is a story of artisans. From the vineyards to the bottle finishes, all the craftsmen cultivate a deep sense of pride in what they do. Their passion is humbling. And their mastery of their craft is absolute, for each and every one. We strive to preserve these savoir-faire within the Maison and encourage transmission.",

It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown–Forman Corporation since 1956. Packaged in square bottles, Jack Daniel's 'Black Label' Tennessee whiskey sold 12.9 million nine-liter cases in 2017. Other brand variations, such as Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Apple, Gentleman Jack, Tennessee Fire, and ready to drink (RTD) products brought the total to more than 16.1 million equivalent adjusted cases for the entire Jack Daniel's family of brands.",
            'title2': "LEGAL STATUS",
            'desc2': "On a state level, Tennessee has imposed stringent requirements. To be labeled as Tennessee whiskey, it is not enough under state law that the whiskey be produced in Tennessee; it must meet quality and production standards. These are the same standards used by Jack Daniel's Distillery, and some other distillers are displeased with the requirements being enshrined into law.",
            'title3': "DISTILLERY",
            'desc3': "The Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg is situated in and around a hollow known as 'Stillhouse Hollow' or 'Jack Daniel's Hollow', where a spring flows from a cave at the base of a limestone cliff. The limestone removes iron from the water, making it ideal for distilling whiskey (water heavy in iron gives whiskey a bad taste).The spring feeds into nearby East Fork Mulberry Creek, which is part of the Elk River watershed. Some 1.9 million barrels containing the aging whiskey are stored in several dozen barrelhouses, some of which adorn the adjacent hilltops and are visible throughout Lynchburg.",

Previous to founding the distillery, he married Margaret Haig (1753–1815) in 1768. She was the eldest daughter of John Haig, a whisky distiller in Scotland. John and Margaret had a family of 16 children, eight sons and eight daughters. Portraits of the couple by Sir Henry Raeburn are on display in the National Gallery of Ireland.",
            'title3': "PRODUCTION PROCESS",
            'desc3': "Jameson is produced from a blend of grain whiskey and single pot still whiskey, which uses a mixture of malted and unmalted or 'green' Irish barley, all sourced from within a fifty-mile radius around the distillery in Cork. The barley is dried in a closed kiln fired by natural gas (formerly anthracite coal). This is in contrast to the traditional method used in some Scotch whisky distilleries, which fire the kiln with peat, adding a distinctive peat flavour.",
